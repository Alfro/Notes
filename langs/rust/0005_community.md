# 5.- Community

Last week we went over `cargo`, but other point I highlighted from Rust two weeks ago was:

> The Rust community is awesome, and that's the reason why Rust is voted most loved language for the 3rd Year in a Row in Stack Overflow Developer Survey (like [Fabien Potencier](http://github.com/fabpot)  says [Community > Docs > Code](https://twitter.com/fabpot/status/994475614588559360)).

The trending article "[Rust and C++ on Floating-point Intensive Code](https://www.reidatcheson.com/hpc/architecture/performance/rust/c++/2019/10/19/measure-cache.html)" reminded me other similar: "[A Little Story About the `yes` Unix Command](https://endler.dev/2017/yes/)". In both, the community helped the authors to improve it. I came for the performace, stayed for the community.

The Rust community do not disappoint (and not only for performance articles, remembering only performance articles is my fault)
